Sometimes I just feel it helps that little bit to know there are others out there who have been through challenges similar 
to us women in STEM - looking at STEM, tech, business leaders can help inspire and uplift and sharpen focus. 

So I'm making this list to refer to for when I, or anyone else out there who finds it helpful, need a little inspiration or guidance.



1. Leda Braga, Systematica - made the leap from sell side to buy side in a leadership role at Bluecrest when she was pregnant. Years later spun out of this role to start her
own fund - Systematica. 


2. Ada Lovelace  - English mathematician and writer, 
chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.  Born: 10 December 1815
