Sometimes I just feel it helps that little bit to know there are others out there who have been through challenges similar 
to us women in STEM - looking at STEM, tech, business leaders can help inspire and uplift and sharpen focus. 

So I'm making this list to refer to for when I, or anyone else out there who finds it helpful, need a little inspiration or guidance.



1. Leda Braga, Systematica - made the leap from sell side to buy side in a leadership role at Bluecrest when she was pregnant. Years later spun out of this role to start her
own fund - Systematica. 


2. Ada Lovelace  - Born: 10 December 1815
Ada Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer. 
Even though she wrote about a computer, the Analytical Engine, that was never built, 
she realized that the computer could follow a series of simple instructions, a program, to perform a complex calculation.
English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed 
mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. 
She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.  


3. Creola Katherine Johnson - portrayed in the movie Hidden Figures with her more commonly known name Katherine Johnson. 
An American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics as a NASA employee were
critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights. 
A literal computer, a human computer (wow!), Katherine calculated the trajectory for the first spaceflight for an American
- for astronaut Alan Shepard's 1961 Freedom 7 mission to space. 



4. Marie Curie 
The first woman to win a Nobel Prize, 
the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel 
Prize in two scientific fields. 
- Notable for her discovery of radium and polonium, and huge contribution to 
finding treatments for cancer. was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist 
who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity.


5. Claudia Goldin 
Harvard professor who was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics in 2023 for her research on women at work.
The prize was given "for having advanced our understanding of women's labour market outcomes".
She is the third woman to win the award, and the first woman to win the award solo.
She is a co-director of the National Bureau of Economic Research's (NBER) Gender in the Economy Study Group
